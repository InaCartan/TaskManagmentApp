____________________________
-- Architecture Describtion --

This App, with simple functions, is made with the three layer architecture.
This architecture consist of a Business Logic, DataAccess and DTO (Data Transfer Object)

The database is made with Entity Framework (EF), that is a framework used to .NET applications. EF is used to work with relational data without focusing on the database tables and columns. Migration is used in this App. 

The API is a ASP.NET Core Web API, that communicates with the backend through the layers.

-- Run Instructions --

Use docker commands in following order:
1) docker-compose up -d db
2) docker-compose run --rm migrator
3) docker-compose up --build -d api

____________________________
-- What's missing --

The frontend to view the functionalities hasn't been added. Though it can be viewed by interacting with the API.

I don't have enough knowledge about JWT and thus I might not be able to implement that. 

I'm not accustomed to react and Django and can't recall if I've been using it before, thus I've gone with c# & .Net.
